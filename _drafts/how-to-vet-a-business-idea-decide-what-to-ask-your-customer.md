Once you've identified your customer segment, the *who-where* pair, it's time to figure out what you're going to talk to them about. This is **Step 2** in the five-step idea process I use:

**Step 1.** [Identify your customer](../how-to-vet-an-idea-identify-your-customer)  
**Step 2.** Decide what to ask your customer  
**Step 3.** Reach your customer  
**Step 4.** Talk to your customer  
**Step 5.** Make sense of your customer  

To recap Step 1, this is the idea we're in the process of vetting:
>  Fully online, text-based entity incorporation and corporate minutebook. No Microsoft Word documents, no wet signatures, no PDFs, no Dropbox. Incorporate and maintain all of your corporate board minutes and stock documents without ever leaving your browser.

And our initial stab at a customer segment is *bootstrapped founders of technology companies hoping to raise money someday but who aren't using a lawyer* that we can find at *indiehackers, startup subreddits, hacker news, and YC startup school forums and slack channels, co-working spaces, meetups for startups and entrepreneurship and startup accelerator information nights*.

We could probably get it even more niche, like focusing just on folks who are attending startup accelerator information nights. But let's stick with what we've got for now.

## Decide What to Ask Your Customer

Before we go into an interview with a customer, we should know the big three things we want to learn. 

To figure this out, I do what [Talking to Humans](https://www.talkingtohumans.com) calls the business assumption exercise. The questions below are taken almost verbatim from the Appendix to the excellent book.

### Business Assumptions Exercise
For the idea, complete the sentences below. For now, they're just guesses or assumptions.[^1]
1. My target customer will be....
> We know this one pretty well already from Step 1. Our target customer is bootstrapped founders of technology companies hoping to raise money someday but who aren't using a lawyer. 
2. The problem my customer wants to solve is...
> What is our customer struggling with or what need do they want to fulfill? We also looked at this during Step 1. In our case, it's that they want to set up and entity and keep all the paperwork properly with a view to a potential fundraise, but current solutions require them to waste time figuring out what documents they need to prepare and sign and and to figure out a recordkeeping system for these documents. [Assumption: this is really that bad of a problem rather than a minor annoyance. Don't they have to set up some cloud drive system anyway for everything non-legal?] 
3. I can solve my customer's need with...
> This should be a very concise elevator pitch of the product. For us, our initial description of the idea seems like a good enough place to start: Fully online, text-based entity incorporation and corporate minutebook. No Microsoft Word documents, no wet signatures, no PDFs, no Dropbox. Incorporate and maintain all of your corporate board minutes and stock documents without ever leaving your browser.
4.  My customer can't solve this today because...
> Ask yourself what are the obstacles that have prevented my customer from solving this already. For us, if our customer does try to solve this, the existing solutions for organizing an entity are confusing, expensive and only deal with half of the problem. Or, sometimes, our customer decides that they don't care enough to figure it out and kick the can down the road. Most of the time, this will just add to the legal fees at the time of a fundraising, but occasionally this results in the breakup of a company because the founders did not hash out important questions about ownership.
5. The measurable outcome my customer wants to achieve is... 
> Can we articulate a measurable change in your customer's life that would make them love the product? This one is tough for us. My best guess here is that it will be a welcome relief from the burden of figuring out how to incorporate. For someone with no experience doing this, it is a lot to figure out. [Assumption: It's a "love" that they'll really only feel once. After a while, a subscription will seem like an unnecessary expense.]
6. My primary customer acquisition tactic will be... 
> You will likely have multiple marketing channels, but there is often one method, at most two, that dominates your customer acquisition. The first marketing channel that come to mind for our idea is through CPAs that deal with early stage technology companies. Although a founder might be able to avoid incorporating, he or she probably can't avoid doing taxes. For any reasonable amount of revenue, a founder will probably hire a CPA. Another potential channel is through those companies that advertise Delaware registered agent services (h/t to my cousin for thinking of this one). Right now, they will try to upsell people on physical corporate minute books. Maybe we can get them to upsell people with an online corporate minute book, instead.
7. My earliest adopter will be... 
> These are the real enthusiasts of the product, the ones who'll buy before the mainstream customer will. It's tough to slice our already pretty narrow customer segment even further, but let's try. Perhaps it's the people for whom this is not just a convenient product, but also one that they identify with philosophically. It's the kind of technical, bootstrapped founder, that prefers plain text over Microsoft Word because he or she thinks plain text is a better and freer mode of storing information over proprietary file formats. I know I'm really stretching here, but these people do exist -- I'm one of them! It's the kind of person who would use ledger-cli over Quickbooks, or plain text log files over the binary journals produced by systemd. There probably aren't a ton of these people in the world. But ledger-cli has 2,600 stars on Github, so we can be semi-confident that there aren't 0 of these people.
8. I will make money (revenue) by...
> The primary way we will make money is by an initial setup fee, and a low annual fee.
9. My primary competition will be...
> The companies that are involved with incorporation: Clerky, LegalZoom, lawyers, and physical corporate minutebook vendors. Indirectly, Microsoft Word, PDFs, DocuSign, and cloud storage such as GDrive and OneDrive are competitors, since currently that's how people keep fully electronic copies of corporate documentation.
10. I will beat my competitors primarily because of...
> Cost and convenience. Clerky is expensive (~$1000 to incorporate**. Lawyers are expensive. We'll be cheap, but recurring. We'll also make it very, very easy to incorporate and keep the information online. Just a few clicks, with the option to dig deeper if they want.
11. My biggest risk to financial viability is...
> This is what could could prevent us from getting to breakeven. I think it's finding a price that's low enough that there's a clear value over our competition, but not so low that we need tens of thousands of people to sign up to break even. 
12. My biggest technical or engineering risk is...
> There aren't really many engineering risks here. I envision this as a pretty simple web application. Maybe there will be a challenge interoperating with government or quasi-government agencies. But I think everyone accepts USPS, and worst case, we can use EasyPost to mail things.

Thinking through these questions is hard work. Struggling through some of them exposes where some of the risks are, which brings us to the most important part of this step: identify the riskiest assumptions. To that end, this next question is open-ended: 

**What assumptions do we have that, if proven wrong, would cause this business to fail?** List no more than 12 assumptions, and market size should almost always be one of them. 
1. This problem is just a minor annoyance while starting a business. It's not a problem anyone thinks about other than in passing. 
1. I'm a lawyer, so I have a distorted (and self-serving) view of the acuity of this problem. If the real downside to no proper recordkeeping is some additional legal fees down the road at the time of a fundraising, my target customers may just think it's not worth solving this problem until they actually raise money.
1. 

Once we've written out the list, choose up to three that would have a large impact on the business and feel highly uncertain. 

Those three assumptions will be the focus of the three big things we want to learn from our customers.

Questioning feels a lot how like I would do an intake interview for a client.

## Footnotes
[^1]: If you've heard of something called the [Lean Canvas](https://leanstack.com/is-one-page-business-model), this is sort of like a written-out version of that. I've never really liked the lean canvas approach. It sort of just confuses me. I think I'm just not a visual thinker when it comes to this stuff.
