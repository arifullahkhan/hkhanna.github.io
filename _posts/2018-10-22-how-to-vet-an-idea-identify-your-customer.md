I have been collecting ideas for software and hardware projects since I was in college. I built some of them. I sort-of-built and then abandoned many more. I never turned any of them into a business. 

To vet an idea for its potential as a business, I decided to talk to people who could be served by the idea. I've never done anything like this before -- I've only written software for myself -- so I knew I needed to bring myself up to speed on what I soon learned was called **customer development**.

There are a wealth of resources on the internet on how to do customer development. I've read everything I can get my hands on.[^1] But for very early stage customer development, when you just want to see if an idea has any profit potential at all, the two books [Talking to Humans](https://www.talkingtohumans.com/) and [The Mom Test](http://momtestbook.com/) really stand out.[^2]

My idea vetting process centers around a set of five core steps:[^3]

**Step 1.** Identify your customer  
**Step 2.** Decide what to ask your customer  
**Step 3.** Reach your customer  
**Step 4.** Talk to your customer  
**Step 5.** Make sense of your customer  

Here's an idea of mine that we'll vet with this process:
>  Fully online, text-based entity incorporation and corporate minutebook. No Microsoft Word documents, no wet signatures, no PDFs, no Dropbox. Incorporate and maintain all of your corporate board minutes and stock documents without ever leaving your browser.

Before we jump into identifying the customer, there is one important takeaway to put front-and-center. It's a theme we'll see throughout all five steps: Remember to start small. Your product should not try to do everything or satisfy every possible customer. If you try to to everything you'll end up doing nothing. A quote from The Mom Test sums it up:

> Startups don't starve, they drown. There are never too few options, too few leads or too few ideas. You always have too many. You get overwhelmed, do a little bit of everything.

If I can be honest with you, I'm very guilty of this. I get excited by the potential of an idea, and I see all the directions it can go. If you're an engineer, I bet you do too. Studying customer development has helped me learn how to narrowly tailor an idea and keep it narrowly tailored unless and until I make the conscious decision to change directions. 

We'll see this important ethic many times, but we'll see it first in identifying our customer segment. 

## Identify Your Customer
A **customer segment** is a "who-where" pair. Who are they and where can I find them? 

If you remember nothing else from this step, remember the definition of customer segment. A *who* without a *where* is not a customer segment. 

The goal of this step is to be able to answer *who* and *where* with total clarity. To get that clarity, the customer segment needs to be as narrow as possible. 

Start with a broad group of potential customers and ask:
- Within this group, which type of person would want it most?
- Would everyone within this group buy / use it, or only some?
- Why does that subset want it? (e.g. what is their specific problem)
- Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some?
- What additional motivations are there?
- Which other types of people have these motivations?

These questions should yield two sets of answers:
- Collection of demographic groups
- Set of goals or motivations

If these answers seem generic, go back and slice it again by repeating the questions above. Within that subgroup, who wants it more? Repeat.

If there isn't a clear physical or digital location at which you can find the customers in your customer segment, then it's probably still too broad. Go back and keep slicing.

At this point, you should have a set of "who-where pairs". You can decide which customer segment to start with based on which segment seems the most: profitable or big, easy to reach or personally rewarding.

> If while talking to customers you aren't finding consistent problems and goals, you don't have a specific enough customer segment.

Don't spend forever on this or spend too much time thinking about this. Just spend a few minutes to get to a concrete initial customer segment so you can go talk to them and move the idea forward.

#### Example: Customer Segmentation for Online Corporate Minutes Idea
OK, so who needs online entity incorporation and minutebook? People starting companies. That's our broad group of potential customers.

##### Slice - Round 1!
- Within the group of "people starting companies", which type of person wants it most?
> People who want or need to form a legal entity, and want to do it and maintain all the paperwork correctly. 

- Would everyone within this group buy it / use it or only some?
> Definitely just some. One group would be small businessowners setting up a legal entity without the help of a lawyer.

- Why does that subset want it, and what is their specific problem?
> The small businessowner views the legal entity paperwork as a distraction from building their business, but they know it's important to preserve the liability shield of organizing an entity.

- Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some?
> Not every small businessowner views legal paperwork as a distraction, I guess. But probably most of them do, especially if they decided against hiring a lawyer.

- What additional motivations are there?
> The unrepresented small businessowner needs to research how to form an entity, using DIY resources like Nolo or googling around for "corporate minute templates". The process of getting all this information, downloading it, signing it and keeping a copy of it somewhere is annoying and there's a good chance this paperwork will get lost.

- Which other types of people have these motivations?
> Another group might be legal professionals who are constantly setting up legal entities for their clients. Putting together the same Microsoft Word forms and keeping them in a filing system can consume much of a paralegal's day. A third group could be tech startup founders who need to put together all the standard formation documents who want to start customer or product development or fundraising and incorporation is a necessary but distracting step.

The demographic groups represented by my answers are small businessowners, legal professionals, and technology startup founders. The small businessowners and technology startup founders have a similar motivation: set up the legal entity quickly and get back to work. The legal professional has a different motivation: minimize paperwork and streamline the tracking of it for all of their clients.

Of the three demographic groups, my guess is the smallbusiness owner would want this the most. But I think the technology founder would want it almost as badly, and I have a much better idea of *where* to find founders of nascent technology companies than I do founders of, say, brick-and-mortar small businesses that are just getting off the ground. 

If we take "technology founders" as the group, is this too generic? Can we slice further?

##### Slice - Round 2!
- Within the group of "technology company founder", which type of person wants it most?
> The kind of technology founder who would be most interested in a totally-online, text-based corporate minute book would be the kind of founder who is bootstapped and not using a lawyer, but wants to make sure all the paperwork is done and kept properly in case they raise a round of funding someday.

- Would everyone within this group buy it / use it or only some?
> These types of founders, if they were aware of it and did not want to pay for more expensive competitors, should all be willing to use it unless they want to spend the time to learn to draft the documents themselves.

- Why does that subset want it, and what is their specific problem?
> The bootstapped founder doesn't want to waste time or money on this, but wants it all done properly and all kept track of for a potential fundraise someday. They don't want to download, print and sign Microsoft Word files. The don't sign up for or pay for DocuSign to sign documents. And they don't want to set up a legal recordkeeping system on GDrive to maintain signed PDFs. Too many steps and services for what should be a simple, repeatable thing. They'd rather just quickly handle what is a minor detail in starting their business without an ongoing time committment from them. 

- Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some?
> Not totally sure, but if we're defining the group as bootstrapped founders, not using lawyers, hoping to raise money someday and who are aware of the need to properly keep their corporate documentation for that purpose, a smart founder is loathe to waste time on preparing their own legal docs or figuring out a way to organize all of it.

- What additional motivations are there?
> The founder is technical, and especially if their technology stack is Linux-heavy, they would like to avoid dealing with Microsoft Word files. 

- Which other types of people have these motivations?
> Technologists, whether or not they are founders of a company, will see the value of capturing this information in plain text. I recognize this is a fairly large assumption. But I am a technologist, and I value the simplicity and portability of plain text over proprietary binaries. 

This feels like a pretty specific group of people. "Bootstrapped founders of technology companies hoping to raise money someday but who aren't using a lawyer" is a mouthful. It feels pretty niche. Their goal, as I've described it, is to set their company up and maintain their corporate records with very little effort or waste of time but in an easily accessible way for future potential investors. OK, so far, so good.

The final test is whether there is a clear physical or digital location where I can find the customers in the customer segment. Digitally, I could find these people on:
- [Indiehackers](https://www.indiehackers.com)
- Subreddits on startups, e.g., [/r/startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups)
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)
- YC Startup School Forums and Slack channels

Physically, it might be a little tougher, but I can go to co-working spaces, meetups for startups and entrepreneurship, and startup accelerator information nights. 

So, I think I know where to find these "bootstrapped founders of technology companies hoping to raise money someday but who aren't using a lawyer".

This is a pretty good *who-where* pair. In other words, we have a concrete guess at our initial customer segment. 

What do we want to learn from them? We'll explore that in Part 2.

## Footnotes
[^1]: If there's one thing I learned in law school, it's that the best way for me to learn something completely new is to read the same thing from two or more different sources and synthesize what I learned into my own writings. In other words, this series of blog posts is more for me than it is for you!
[^2]: My process for understanding the business potential of an idea and much of the information in this series of blog posts comes from those two books. If you enjoy this topic, I highly recommend you get both of them.
[^3]: If you've read any of my [other blog posts](../structuring-deep-learning-projects), you know I have a weird habit of breaking everything down into steps in a process.
