Never Eat Alone, written by Keith Ferrazzi, is a book on building and maintaining relationships with people. This post contains my personal notes from reading the book. 

I read this book to help me improve my relationships with others in my life.

> These "Book Notes" are inspired by [Derek Sivers' Book Notes](https://sivers.org/book). When I take the time to read a book, I take a few moments to distill the core concepts into something I can refer back to without having to go back through the book. Until now, I kept those notes private, but realized there is no reason not to share them with interested people. 

> Be warned: these notes are rough and can be stream-of-thought at times, since I did not capture them with a view to publication. I hope to continue to refine them over time as I refer to them.

- Anything at this list level is from the book.
  - Anything at this list level contains my thoughts.

Anything with the symbol <i class="fa fa-road"></i> is an action item for me.

## Be Interesting (25)
- Marketers and connectors alike take heed: Be Interesting!
- Read The New York Times and keep up with current events to help make you interesting.
- People don't only hire people they like, they hire people whom they think can make them and their companies better, which usually means people with an expanded view of the world. 

### Become an Expert: Have a Unique Point of View
- To win at things, all of your efforts must be powered by a deep passion and set of beliefs that go beyond just your own personal benefit. To move others, you must speak beyond yourself. Boldly putting yourself out there is necessary but not sufficient. There's a difference between getting attention and getting attention for your desire to change the world.
  - <i class="fa fa-road"></i> Think about what us that passion for you?
- You have to believe in something for people to believe in you. 
- At every stage of your career, have some expertise or content that differentiates you from others. A cause, idea, trend or skill -- unique subject matter on which you are the authority.
  - At my current employer, my M&A skill probably differentiates me from others on the legal team.
  - I have been trying to make my data science skills a differentiator, but it has not gotten the traction I had hoped.
  - I have been getting involved with contract automation. They may end up being a differentiator.

### Talking to Journalists
- Journalists are hungry for ideas. Just call and ask for them.
- Calls won't go unreturned after leaving a message that says, e.g., “I’ve got the inside scoop on how the gaming industry is going to revolutionize marketing. I’ve appreciated your work for a long time now; I believe you are the right person to break this story.”
- Create a story about your company and the ideas it embodies that readers will care about. That’s your content. Then share it. Have you ever picked up the phone and actually talked to a reporter about why you think what you do is so special? You cannot outsource this to PR; journalists deal with thousands of PR people a day. Who’s going to be more passionate and more informed than you? You’re the expert on what you do.

### Become a Content Creator
- Content creators are always in high demand, asked to speak at conferences, featured in magazines. Everyone in the industry knows their names.
- Their fame comes from always seeming to be one step ahead. How do you do that? Latch onto the latest, most cutting-edge idea in the business world. Immerse yourself in it. Distill that into a message about the idea’s broader impact to others and how it could be applied in the industry you work in. Teach, write and speak about it. That's it.
  - AI is probably the most trendy, cutting edge thing right now in the business world. 
  - <i class="fa fa-road"></i> Look into what else is cutting edge in the business world. Maybe more theoretical things? Write something about its impact on the legal world. 
- Forget your job title and job description. Figure out what expertise you're going to master that will provide real value to your network and your company.
- Develop a niche: think of several areas where your company underperformance and choose to focus on the one area that is least attended to.
  - It looked to me like ICA automation was being neglected at work because we didn't have ATG anymore. It was a niche I thought I could add a lot of value since it felt like an area we were underperforming. 
- Follow the money: creativity is worthless if it can't be applied. Pick something that will make or save someone money. 
- Use emotion to convince your doubters that underdogs sometimes win and Goliaths sometimes crumble.

## Build it and They Will Come (29)
Consider building a club or organization in your niche.

## Never Give In to Hubris (30)
Don't be a jerk when things get good. You'll start to pick up momentum; one powerful contact will lead to the next. It will be a fun and motivating ride. Don't be a jerk when this happens; stay humble.

## Find Mentors, Find Mentees. Repeat (31)
Teaching and mentoring people is important and helps build relationships. 

## Balance is B.S. (32)
Work and personal life shouldn't be separated for purposes of building connections with people. I.e., "balance" between work and personal life is B.S.
